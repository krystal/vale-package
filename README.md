# Krystal Vale Package

This repository contains a [Vale-compatible](https://vale.sh/) implementation of what we hope to turn into a Krystal style guide.

## Getting Started

To get started, add the package to your configuration file (as shown below) and then run `vale sync`.

```ini
StylesPath = styles # Use your normal style path here.
Packages = https://github.com/krystal/vale-package/releases/latest/download/vale.zip
```

See [Vale's documentation on packages](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/packages/) for more information.
